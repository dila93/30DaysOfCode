# 30DaysOfCode (Deprecated)
### 30 days of code from hackerrank in Javascript

#### I migrated this code to a new repository using typescript for two reasons: 
1. Javascript was not enough to continue doing the 30 days of code at day 21.
2. I should to use an strongly typed language (TypeScript) to use Generic types and other characteristics.
